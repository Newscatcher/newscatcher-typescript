/**
 * The response model for the search requests applies to the `Search`, `Latest Headlines`, `Search by link`, and `Authors` endpoints. Response field behavior:
 * - Required fields are guaranteed to be present and non-null.
 * - Optional fields may be `null`/`undefined` if the data couldn't be extracted during processing.
 * - To access article properties in the `articles` response array, use array index notation. For example, `articles[n].title`, where `n` is the zero-based index of the article object (0, 1, 2, etc.).
 * - The `nlp` property within the article object `articles[n].nlp` is only available with NLP-enabled subscription plans.
