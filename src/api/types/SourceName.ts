/**
 * Specifies terms to search within the source names. To specify multiple terms, use a comma-separated string or an array of strings.
 *
 * Examples:
 * - `"sport, tech"`
 * - `["sport", "tech"]`
 *
 * **Note**: The search does not require an exact match and returns all sources that include the specified terms anywhere in their names. You can use any word, phrase, or outlet name, such as `"sport"`, or `"new york times"`. For example, using `"sport"` as a term returns sources like `"Motorsport"`, `"Dot Esport"`, and `"Tuttosport"`.
